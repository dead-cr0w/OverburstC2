You can use a collection of network security evaluation tools designed to identify vulnerabilities in various devices.
**Intended for educational purposes and authorized security testing only.**

### **DVR Scanner**
- Tests DVR devices for XML injection vulnerabilities in the NTP configuration.

### **ZHONE Router Scanner**
- Tests ZHONE routers for command injection via the ping diagnostic feature.

### **Fiber Router Scanner**
- Scans fiber routers running the BOA web server for command injection vulnerabilities.

### **Telnet Brute Force**
- Attempts common credential combinations on IoT and network devices via Telnet.
